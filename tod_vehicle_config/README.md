# tod_vehicle_config

This package contains the config files of the teleoperated vehicles. To create a new config, create a new directory in [vehicle_config/](https://github.com/TUMFTM/tod_vehicle_interface/tree/master/tod_vehicle_config/vehicle_config), and follow the conventions regarding file, parameter and directory names.

Building the package, and thus providing the config files to the other packages of the software stack, is done in a typical ROS manner (via CMakeLists.txt and package.xml).
